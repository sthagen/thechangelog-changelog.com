      This is also a video podcast that will be posted to our <a href="https://youtube.com/changelog">YouTube channel</a>! In addition to full video, we'll also be sharing clips and highlights to <a href="https://youtube.com/changelog">Shorts</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@changelog.com">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/changelog_">Instagram</a>. Things you'll need to prepare for this:

    </ol>

    <h3 id="local-recording">Backup setup</h3>

    <p><a href="https://riverside.fm">Riverside</a> takes care of recording everyone's local audio and video. As a backup to that (because Murphy's Law), we ask that you <mark>please record a local version as well</mark>. Here's some videos on how to do that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>On macOS, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/Xey7GoqTEPE?t=60">using the built-in QuickTime Player</a></li>
      <li>On Windows, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/2AU6mxF7RRw?t=107">using the built-in Camera app</a></li>
      <li>On Linux, we suggest <a href="https://youtu.be/cQTKTN5iw7w?t=10">using OBS Studio</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><mark>Note:</mark> You will need ~10-20 GB of free disk space for this (varies by setup / show duration)</p>
